Troubleshooting
---------------------------------------------------------

These are the possible problems and their respective 
solutions among them are:


- The default directory is $Home/lakesnes and should 
not be changed.

- ROM names should not contain spaces; in this case, 
use a hyphen. For example, megaman x should be 
changed to megaman_x.

- The default saves and states directory is 
/$Home/.local/share/LakeSnes/. The saves and states 
folder will be located within this directory.

- When referring to the $HOME path, it is clear 
that it will be the path /home/username/lakesnes.

- First execute Start and show the frontend ,for load
 roms click on Open File.
